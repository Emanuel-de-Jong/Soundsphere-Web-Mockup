                            plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the
                            overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
                            with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
                            can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
